# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Added
- **AltServer for AltStore Classic** (`altkeeper altserver`, or `serve --altserver`): AltStore's
  *Refresh All* and installing, updating or removing apps work with this machine answering instead
  of AltServer on a computer. It announces itself over Bonjour and speaks AltStore's own protocol
  (port 49500 by default, `--altserver-port` to change it).
- **Web page** (`serve`) in Italian for people who are not comfortable with a terminal: state of the
  apps, renew, sign in with the Apple ID (including the verification code). Protected by a PIN
  (`ALTKEEPER_WEB_PIN`), which is required when it listens outside the machine itself.
- **Docker image** (`Dockerfile`, `examples/docker-compose.yml`) and a GitHub Actions workflow that
  tests the code and publishes the image to ghcr.io on tags.
- The iPhone is found by itself: last known address, Bonjour, then a scan of the local network.
- `ALTKEEPER_ANISETTE_URL` to use your own anisette server.
- `altkeeper --version`.
- Notifications (ntfy) and cron examples in `examples/`.

### Changed
- **Renamed from altrefresh to AltKeeper.** The binary, the image and the variables are now
  `altkeeper` / `ALTKEEPER_*`. The old `ALTREFRESH_*` variable names still work.
- `renew` renews per app and signs in to Apple only when something is actually due.

### Fixed
- Sign-in failing with HTTP 429: Apple's servers limit the requests on one connection, so each
  request now uses its own connection. The client also presents itself as a Mac, like AltServer.
- AltStore reporting "AltServer could not be found" while another operation was running: the phone
  is locked only while it is in use.
- Bonjour answers going missing when two discovery daemons ran in the same process.

### Known limitations
- Only one AltServer should run on the network at a time.
- Tested on an iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 27.0) with AltStore Classic; it relies on private Apple APIs and
  on AltStore's protocol, which can change without notice.
- The AltServer port has no login, exactly like the real AltServer: keep it inside your home network.

## 0.1.0

- First version: renews an iPhone's provisioning profiles over Wi-Fi with a free Apple ID, using
  remote pairing, from a machine that stays on at home.
